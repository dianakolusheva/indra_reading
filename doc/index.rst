High Throughput INDRA Reading Documentation
===========================================

One of the key features of INDRA (the Integrated Network and Dynamical
Reasoning Assembler) is that it can use and distill information from many
machine readers. It is thus natural to want to run those readers on a
large amount of text.

This code provides a framework for integrating multiple readers at scale,
while providing a uniform API to interact with the readers anonymously.
This last feature allows new readers to be integrated with ease.
