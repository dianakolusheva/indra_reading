# INDRA Reading

This repo, originally a part of INDRA, contains tools used for large 
scale reading, mostly using AWS Batch.

The tools in this repo were not designed with general outside use in mind,
and a some special setup is required to be able to run the various readers,
even more so if you wish to run them on AWS. None of the AWS configuration
is codified here (as of this writing).
